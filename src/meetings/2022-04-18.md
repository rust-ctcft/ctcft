## Agenda

The theme for this month is **Learning**. [Please submit talk proposals!](https://github.com/rust-lang/ctcft/issues/new/choose)

The theme of April's CTCFT is "learning". Doc Jones will speak about the Rustc
Reading Club Phase II, and what was learned from the first iteration of the
club. Jon Gjengset will talk about teaching advanced Rust concepts.

- (5 min) Opening remarks ðŸ‘‹ ([angelonfira])
- (20 min) Rustc Reading Club Phase II ([doc-jones])
    - The Rustc Reading Club has two goals. First, to produce confident new
      contributors to rustc. Second, to deepen understanding of rustc for mid
      level contributors. The structure of RRC enables participants to gain
      experience working with other contributors making their future
      collaborations easier. [Phase I of the Rustc Reading Club] is complete and
      now we are ready to launch Phase II based on what we've learned. Phase I
      focused solely on rustc's name resolver module. We plan to expand and
      "read" other areas of the compiler in Phase II.
- (20 min) Teaching Advanced Rust ([jonhoo])
    - Over the past few years I've spent a lot of time trying to teach Rust
      "beyond the basics", focusing my attention on the problems that developers
      who have read all the introductory materials run into when they sit down
      to actually use Rust "for real'. In this session I'll talk about some
      recurring patterns I've seen while doing this, in the hope that they may
      spawn interesting discussion about possible solutions.
- (5 min) Closing ([angelonfira])

## Social hour

Like always, we'll be running a social hour after the CTCFT. The idea is really
simple: for the hour after the meeting, we will create breakout rooms in Zoom.
You can join any breakout room you like and hang out.
