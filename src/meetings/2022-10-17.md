## Lightning Talks

This month, we're going to try a less theme-focused CTCFT with general Lightning Talks! We're hoping that this can be an easy way to give people a platform with lower organizational overhead. If you're interested in giving a 5-10 minute talk, sign up on [this issue][registration].

## Social hour

Like always, we'll be running a social hour after the CTCFT. The idea is really
simple: for the hour after the meeting, we will create breakout rooms in Zoom
with different themes. You can join any breakout room you like and hang out.
